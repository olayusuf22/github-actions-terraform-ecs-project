Steps:
Deploy Pipeline to Build

Utilize a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) tool such as Jenkins, GitLab CI, or AWS CodePipeline to set up a pipeline for automating the deployment process.
Configure AWS Credential

Ensure that appropriate AWS credentials with necessary permissions are configured in the CI/CD environment to interact with AWS services.
Build AWS Infrastructure

Define the infrastructure as code using tools like AWS CloudFormation or Terraform to provision resources such as EC2 instances, ECR repositories, S3 buckets, RDS databases, etc.
Create ECR Repository

Set up an Elastic Container Registry (ECR) repository to store Docker images.
Start Self-hosted EC2 Runner

Deploy a self-hosted EC2 runner using tools like GitLab Runner or GitHub Actions Runner to execute pipeline jobs.
Build and Push Docker Image to ECR

Utilize Docker to build the application's image and push it to the ECR repository.
Create Environment File and Export to S3

Store environment-specific configurations in files and upload them to an S3 bucket for easy retrieval during deployment.
Migrate Data into RDS Database with Flyway

Use Flyway or a similar database migration tool to manage and apply database schema changes, ensuring consistency across environments.
Stop Self-hosted EC2 Runner

Once the pipeline execution is complete, shut down the self-hosted EC2 runner to minimize costs and resource usage.
Create New Task Definition Revision

Update the ECS task definition with the latest Docker image version and any configuration changes.
Restart ECS Fargate Service

Restart the ECS Fargate service to apply the changes specified in the updated task definition.
Summary
This method automates the building, deployment, and management of AWS infrastructure, Dockerized applications, and database migrations. By setting up a CI/CD pipeline and leveraging infrastructure as code principles, developers can streamline the development and deployment process while ensuring consistency and reliability across environments.
